# Project Name
Weekend-Salary-Calculator
## Description

Duration to complete: 3 hours

Created an application that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.
The application stores the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, the  monthly cost is calculated and appended to the DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color is added to the total monthly cost.

Added a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. Drew from past activities and combined elements to create this application.
